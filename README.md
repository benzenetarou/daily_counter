You can know how many words your repository has.  
Let slack notify.  
I suppose the case you use github repository like dairy.  
In my case, I use another repository as memorandom in English for practice.  
With this you can know the outcome regularly.

To run on AWS lambda  

`clone this repository`  
`$ pip install bs4 -t .`  
`$ pip install requests -t .`  
`$ zip -r upload.zip *`  

Then upload upload.zip on AWS lambda.
